## ðŸ§© Quanta 2018

It's a race robot with obstacle avoidance capability.

### ðŸ“Œ My opinion

In this project we exceeded the expectations of the competition in expectation and with a simpler project we could have spent more time investing in improvements and calibration.

### ðŸ¤“ **3D** modeling **4noobs**

The robot was designed and planned in a 3D modeling, but with a short time the 3D model ends up having no room for unforeseen events and possible reprints.

### ðŸš— Axis design problem

We would not make an axis-steering robot again. It's a great challenge and once done it can even be interesting, but it would be possible to win without such an axis.

## ðŸ§© OBR 2019

Was a competition held with the objective of creating an autonomous robot, with features such as:
1. follow the line
2. recognize intersections and signs
2. avoid obstacles
3. find, capture, move and drop objects.

### ðŸ“Œ My Opinion

We did a good job in this competition, our robot was the most performant in tight turns due to the control we programmed. I think it's a good inspiration, but as a personal recommendation I wouldn't program 100% of the project in the lego interface, unless I had a powerful computer.

### ðŸ“Š PID controller

Fizemos para este robÃ´ um controlador PID (Proporcional Integral Derivativo) que depois de um certo trabalho para aprender, interpretar e calibrar, nos trouxe uma precisÃ£o e suavidade muito boas nas curvas. Toma um certo tempo e exige uma boa base matemÃ¡tica entender este controle, um controle apenas proporcional, se bem calibrado, tambÃ©m poderia ter bons resultados.
