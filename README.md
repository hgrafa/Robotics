## Quanta 2018

This is a repository just to archive and share ideas about our robot in QUANTA competition in 2018. It's a race robot with obstacle avoidance capability.

### My opinion

In this project we exceeded the expectations of the competition in expectation and with a simpler project we could have spent more time investing in improvements and calibration.

### 4D4N (**3D** modeling **4noobs** )

The robot was designed and planned in a 3D modeling, but with a short time the 3D model ends up having no room for unforeseen events and possible reprints.

### Axis design problem

2. We would not make an axis-steering robot again. It's a great challenge and once done it can even be interesting, but it would be possible to win without such an axis.
